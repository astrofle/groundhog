# `groundhog`

Arbovale's response to `GBTIDL`.

Currently, `groundhog` can:

   * Calibrate position switched observations.
   * Calibrate position switched maps.
   * Derive the temperature of the noise diode from position switched observations.

This is still a work in progress :)


## Setup

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/astrofle/groundhog.git`

`cd groundhog`

then run `createEnv` to get your environment set up

`createEnv groundhog-venv`

or install `goundhog` in your current environment

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`pip install .`


## Examples

Examples can be found in the `examples` directory.
